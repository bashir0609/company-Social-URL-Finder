## Visual Summary

Above the results table, you'll see:

```
Total: 500    ✅ Success: 350    ❌ Failed: 150
```

This shows at a glance:
- **Total:** Total companies processed
- **Success:** Companies with at least one social link found
- **Failed:** Companies with no data found

## Use Case: Re-Process Failures

### Workflow

**Step 1: Fast Mode Processing**
```
1. Upload 500 companies
2. Process with FAST_MODE=true
3. Complete in 50-75 minutes
4. Success rate: ~60-70%
```

**Step 2: Export Failed Results**
```
1. Click "Failed Only" button
2. Downloads: 2025-10-22 companies FAILED.xlsx
3. Contains: 150-200 failed companies
```

**Step 3: Re-Process with Normal Mode**
```
1. Disable fast mode: FAST_MODE=false
2. Upload the FAILED.xlsx file
3. Process again (30-40 minutes)
4. Success rate: ~90-95%
```

**Step 4: Merge Results**
```
1. Export success from first run
2. Export success from second run
3. Manually merge or use both files
```

**Total Success Rate: 95%+ in 80-115 minutes!**

         result.twitter !== 'Not found' ||
         result.instagram !== 'Not found' ||
         result.youtube !== 'Not found' ||
         result.tiktok !== 'Not found' ||
         result.pinterest !== 'Not found' ||
         result.website;
});
```

### Failed Filter
```typescript
const failedResults = bulkResults.filter(result => {
  return result.linkedin === 'Not found' &&
         result.facebook === 'Not found' &&
         result.twitter === 'Not found' &&
         result.instagram === 'Not found' &&
         result.youtube === 'Not found' &&
         result.tiktok === 'Not found' &&
         result.pinterest === 'Not found' &&
         !result.website;
});

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High Success Rate
```
Input: 500 companies
Success: 450 (90%)
Failed: 50 (10%)

Action: Export failed, re-process with normal mode
Time: 5-10 minutes to re-process
Result: 95%+ success rate
```

### Scenario 2: Low Success Rate
```
Input: 500 companies
Success: 250 (50%)
Failed: 250 (50%)

Action: 
1. Export failed
2. Disable fast mode
3. Re-process all 250
Time: 40-50 minutes
Result: 85-90% success rate
```

### Scenario 3: Partial Re-Processing
```
Input: 500 companies
Success: 350 (70%)
Failed: 150 (30%)

Action:
1. Export success (keep these)
2. Export failed
3. Review failed list
4. Re-process top 50 priority companies
Time: 10-15 minutes
Result: 80%+ success rate
```

## Tips

### 1. Always Export Failed
```
Even if success rate is high, export failed results for:
- Future reference
- Pattern analysis
- Potential re-processing
```

### 2. Check Failed Patterns
```
Common failure patterns:
- Slow websites (timeout)
- Blocked by firewall (403)
- No social media presence
- Incorrect company names
```

### 3. Adjust Strategy
```
If many failures:
- Increase timeout
- Disable fast mode
- Use different search engine
- Verify company names
```

### 4. Merge Results
```
After re-processing:
1. Open SUCCESS.xlsx
2. Open FAILED SUCCESS.xlsx
3. Copy rows from second to first
4. Save as final results
```
