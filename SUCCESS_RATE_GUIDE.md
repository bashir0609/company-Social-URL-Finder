## 🎮 How to Use

### For Best Results:

1. **Use Official Company Names**
   - ✅ Good: "Microsoft Corporation"
   - ✅ Good: "Apple Inc"
   - ❌ Avoid: "MSFT", "AAPL"

   - System will normalize and process

3. **Use Hybrid Mode**
   - Combines AI + Extraction
   - Best accuracy for complex cases

4. **Check Logs**
   - Console shows detailed progress
   - See which patterns worked

## 🔍 Understanding Results

### Status Messages:
- **"Success"** - Found website + social links
- **"Success (Hybrid)"** - AI + Extraction combined
- **"Failed: Could not find website"** - Try entering URL directly
- **"Failed: Could not fetch website"** - Website may be down

### Social Link Results:
- **Full URL** - Profile found and verified
- **"Not found"** - No profile exists or couldn't be verified
- Check contact page manually for additional links

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Low Success Rate?
1. **Check company names** - Use official names
2. **Verify internet connection** - Timeouts may indicate network issues
3. **Try smaller batches** - For bulk processing
4. **Check console logs** - See what's being tried

### Specific Issues:

**"Could not find website"**
- Try entering domain directly (e.g., "company.com")
- Check if company has a website
- Try different name variations

**"Timeout errors"**
- Website may be very slow
- Try again in a few seconds
- Check if website is accessible in browser

**"Rate limited"**
- Wait 30-60 seconds
- Reduce bulk processing speed
- Use smaller batches

---

## 📈 Performance Tips

### Optimize Bulk Processing:
1. **Clean your data** - Remove duplicates
2. **Use official names** - Better accuracy
3. **Process in batches** - 50-100 at a time
4. **Monitor progress** - Check results as they come

### Speed vs Accuracy:
- **Fast mode**: Use extraction only (5-7s per company)
- **Accurate mode**: Use hybrid (8-12s per company)
- **Best mode**: Hybrid with all platforms (current default)
