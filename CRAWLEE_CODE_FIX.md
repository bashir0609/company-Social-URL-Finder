# Crawlee Code Fix - Result Capture Issue ✅

## Problem Discovered

After installing the `playwright` package and browser binaries, Crawlee was running but **not returning results properly**.

### Symptoms
```
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Starting the crawler.
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Finished! Total 0 requests: 0 succeeded, 0 failed.
```

The crawler was starting and finishing, but:
- ❌ No requests were being processed
- ❌ Results were not being captured
- ❌ Always fell back to Playwright

## Root Cause

**The `result` variable was not being properly captured from inside the async `requestHandler`.**

### Original Code (Broken)
```typescript
export async function scrapeWithCrawlee(url: string): Promise<CrawleeScrapedData> {
  let result: CrawleeScrapedData = { /* ... */ };

  const crawler = new PlaywrightCrawler({
    async requestHandler({ page, request, log }) {
      // Updates result here
      result = { /* ... */ };
    },
  });

  await crawler.run([url]);
  return result;  // ❌ Returns before requestHandler completes!
}
```

### Why It Failed
1. `crawler.run()` is asynchronous and returns immediately
2. The `requestHandler` runs in a separate async context
3. By the time `result` is updated, the function has already returned
4. The returned `result` is always the initial empty state

## The Fix

**Wrap the crawler in a Promise that resolves when the crawler completes.**

### Fixed Code
```typescript
export async function scrapeWithCrawlee(url: string): Promise<CrawleeScrapedData> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    let result: CrawleeScrapedData = { /* ... */ };

    const crawler = new PlaywrightCrawler({
      async requestHandler({ page, request, log }) {
        // Updates result here
        result = { /* ... */ };
      },
      
      failedRequestHandler({ request, log }, error) {
        result.success = false;
      },
    });

    // Wait for crawler to complete, then resolve with result
    crawler.run([url]).then(() => {
      resolve(result);  // ✅ Resolves after requestHandler completes!
    }).catch((error) => {
      console.error('Crawlee run error:', error);
      resolve(result);
    });
  });
}
```

## What Changed

### 1. Wrapped in Promise
```typescript
return new Promise((resolve) => {
  // ... crawler setup ...
  
  crawler.run([url]).then(() => {
    resolve(result);  // Return result AFTER crawler completes
  });
});
```

### 2. Added Error Handling
```typescript
.catch((error) => {
  console.error('Crawlee run error:', error);
  resolve(result);  // Still resolve even on error
});
```

### 3. Updated Both Functions
- ✅ `scrapeWithCrawlee()` - Full scraper
- ✅ `quickScrapeWithCrawlee()` - Lightweight version

### 4. Better Logging
```typescript
if (crawleeResult.success) {
  console.log(`✅ Crawlee scraping successful for ${url}`);
  console.log(`   Found ${Object.keys(crawleeResult.socialLinks).length} social links`);
  return crawleeResult;
} else {
  console.log('⚠️ Crawlee completed but found no data, trying Playwright');
}
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### When Crawlee Finds Data
```
⚠️ Axios found limited data, trying Crawlee (production scraper)
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Starting the crawler.
INFO  Scraping https://example.com
INFO  Successfully scraped https://example.com
INFO  Found 3 social links
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Finished! Total 1 requests: 1 succeeded, 0 failed.
✅ Crawlee scraping successful for https://example.com
   Found 3 social links
```

### When Crawlee Finds No Data
```
⚠️ Axios found limited data, trying Crawlee (production scraper)
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Starting the crawler.
INFO  Scraping https://example.com
INFO  Found 0 social links
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Finished! Total 1 requests: 1 succeeded, 0 failed.
⚠️ Crawlee completed but found no data, trying Playwright
```

### When Crawlee Fails
```
⚠️ Axios found limited data, trying Crawlee (production scraper)
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Starting the crawler.
ERROR Request https://example.com failed after retries: timeout
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Finished! Total 1 requests: 0 succeeded, 1 failed.
❌ Crawlee failed: [error message], trying Playwright
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `pages/api/crawlee-scraper.ts`
- ✅ Wrapped `scrapeWithCrawlee()` in Promise
- ✅ Wrapped `quickScrapeWithCrawlee()` in Promise
- ✅ Added proper error handling
- ✅ Results now captured correctly

### 2. `pages/api/scraper.ts`
- ✅ Added better logging for Crawlee success
- ✅ Added logging for Crawlee no-data case
- ✅ Improved error messages

## Testing

### Test with a JavaScript-heavy site
```
Company: "Shopify"
Expected: Crawlee should find social links
```

### Test with a simple site
```
Company: "Microsoft"
Expected: Axios might find data first, or Crawlee as backup
```

### Test with a blocked site
```
Company: [site that blocks scrapers]
Expected: Crawlee should handle with retries and anti-blocking
```

## Technical Details

### Async Context Issue
The problem was a classic async/await timing issue:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Returns before handler completes
async function wrong() {
  let data;
  crawler.run().then(() => { data = 'value'; });
  return data;  // Returns undefined!
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Waits for handler to complete
async function correct() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    let data;
    crawler.run().then(() => { 
      data = 'value';
      resolve(data);  // Returns 'value'!
    });
  });
}
```

### Why This Pattern Works
1. Creates a Promise that won't resolve until we say so
2. Crawler runs and updates the `result` variable
3. When crawler completes, we call `resolve(result)`
4. The Promise returns the updated result
5. Caller receives the correct data

## Summary

### Problem
✅ **Crawlee was running but not returning results due to async timing issue**

### Solution
✅ **Wrapped crawler in Promise that resolves after completion**

### Result
✅ **Crawlee now properly captures and returns scraped data**  
✅ **Better logging shows when Crawlee succeeds or fails**  
✅ **Fallback chain works correctly: Axios → Crawlee → Playwright**

---

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Crawlee should now properly scrape and return results!

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Code fixed
2. 🔄 Restart dev server to pick up changes
3. 🔄 Test with a company search
4. 🔄 Verify Crawlee logs show "1 succeeded" instead of "0 succeeded"
5. 🔄 Confirm social links are found by Crawlee
